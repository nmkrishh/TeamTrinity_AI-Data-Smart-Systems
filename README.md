Trinity AI - Low bandwidth Chatbot

Problem Statement (P)
Low-Bandwidth AI Assistant for Rural Areas

Many rural areas face poor internet connectivity and limited access to advanced AI platforms. Modern AI systems require high-speed internet and powerful infrastructure, making them inaccessible for students and teachers in low-resource regions.

This creates a digital divide where rural learners cannot benefit from AI-powered education tools. There is a strong need for a lightweight AI solution that works efficiently on low bandwidth and limited network environments.
